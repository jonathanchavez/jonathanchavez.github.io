    <td height="329" colspan="7"><p>Water is a transparent fluid which makes up ocean, lakes and streams. It is a chemical compoud that contains one oxegyen and two hydrogen it is called H2O. Many things depend on water for survivial. It can freeze up and turn into ice and it can melt and turn into gas. Water covers 71% of earth and the rest 29% is land, 95.5% of water is found on the ocean and the rest is found in groundwater and glaciers. Even when water is esstinial to humans water is use alot in different areas such as cooking, electricty, cooling, fighting fires, recreation and much more.</p>
    <p>How does water move around and get to different places? Water moves around through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration condensation, precipation and runoff. All of these words help get the water around so plants can use it to survive or help other things that depend on water to survie.</p>
    <p>Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other animals without safe drinking water we wouldn't be able to drink the water and therefore be without water and won't survie since not safe drinking water has things that can harm humans and other animals so we need safe drinking water to survive. Scientist predict half of the world population would face a water crisis in 2025. </p>

    <p>Water has a high surface tension thats why some bugs can walk on water beacuse the bugs weight is less than the surface tension of water. Why does water have a high surface tension? Because water molecule stick and clump together to form its high surface tension. Also thats why water comes in drop and its falling if there was no gravity the water would appear in a spheical shape.</p></td>

Water that is cold down is organize into tight structure slowing down the molecules causeing water to expand and decrease in density. It occupy a larger volume adding about 9% in volume.</p>
    <p>When water is room temperature they are clump together into small groups of particles they are small allowing water to move freely and are also in groups so they are big enough to not be gas.</p>
    <p> When water is heat up the molecule are moving around fast and are charge up with energy they are moving around too fast that they can't group up and they float and go into gas. In the diagram you can see the temperature and the phase changes that goes along with the temperature in water</p></td>

      <p>Water in a pure state has a neutral pH but only in its pure state and because water neutral pH in pure state water is neither acidic or basic. Water pH can change when substance are dissolved in water.</p>
      <p>Water is a universal solvent. It can dissolve many different chemical compounds.</p>
      <p>Water molecules are the only substances on Earth that exists in all three physical states of matter: solid, liquid and gas</p>
    <p>Water molecules exist in liquid form in important range of temperature from 0-100 Celsius this is important because this range allow water molecules to exist as liquid in most places on Earth.</p>
    <p>The density of water is 1,000Â kg/m3 at 4 Celsius.</p>
    <p>Water can be spilt by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen and the engery require to split water into hydrogen and oxygen is greater then putting them together.</p>
    <p>Oxygen atom carries a little negative charge and the hydrogen carries a little postive charge beacuse the water molecule are not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than the hydrogen atom</p></td>

      <p>Water goes from the ocean and large bodies by a process called evaporation. Where liquid turns into gas mainly by the sun that has solar engery. Also transpiration which is the process of water movement through a plant and then the water in the plant gets evaporation from the plants leaves and other arieal parts of a plant. The process or condensation turns excess water vapors to cloud droplets mainly when warm air rises and its cools and also losses its capacity to hold water vapors.</p>

    <p>Half of the world's hostipal beds are filled with people suffering from a water-related disease.</p>
    <p>Found in the Pacific ocean, the Mariana Trench is the deepest know point in the world's oceans.</p>
    <p>Ocean tides are caused by the rotation of the Earth and the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun acting on the ocean water.</p>
    <p>Water from the sea or ocean is know as seawater. On average every kilogram (2.2lb) of seawater contains around 35 grams (1.2oz) of dissolved salt.</p>
    <p>The longest river in the world is the Nile river. It reaches 6650 kilometers in length (4312 miles).</p>
    <p>Water can move up narrow tube against the force of gravity in what is know as capillary action.</p>
    <p>Water in the form of ice is found at the polar ice caps of the planet Mars some scientists have also suggested the possibility of liquid water on the red planet.    </p></td>

    <p>Water in the form of Ice is located in Mars at the poles and regolith. Ice on Earth moon in carters and volcanic rocks.

    <td height="284" colspan="4"><p>Humans use water for agriculture and its mainly use for irrigation which helps with the farms. Irriagation takes up 90% of the water in some developing countries.</p>
    <p>Water can also be use in science, the absoulte weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter. In another places the Kelvin temperature scale is based on the triple point of water as 273 k = 0.01C. The scale is an absoulte temperature scale. </p>
    <p>One of the most popular uses for water is drinkiing it, and it is also a human use for water so that's why it belongs here. The human body contains about 55% to 78% water it varies because people have different body size. The body requires between one and seven liters of water a day. If you don't get enough amount of water you can experience dehydration. The single largest freshwater resource suitable for drinking is Lake Baikai in Serbia.</p></td>

      <p>Many people count on water for transportation with be from getting from one side to another or by transportating cargo it is also important of the worlds economy.</p>
    <p>Firefighters uses water to help with forset fires or other fires. Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. There are also risk involves water can have steam explosion which can happen when water is used on very hot fires in confided spaces. Also a hydrogen explosion when substances reacts with water, substance such as coal, charcoal or coke graphite decompose the water which produce water gas. A synthesis gas containing monoxide and hydrogen. A hydrogen explosion can be devastating which can be seen in the Chernobyl disaster where a catastrophic nuclear accident that happen at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
    <p>People also make money off of water, the Water industry provides drinking water and wastewater servieces to homes and industry. Some examples are water wells, water supply networks, water tanks, aqeuducts and other ways that provide drinking water and wastewater to homes and industry. Mainly taken the water from springs and lakes, wells and other ways.</p>
    <p>Water also can provide engery by hydropower which comes from water driving a water turbine that is connected to a generator, placed in Dams they use the water to have low-cost non pullating engery. Water power can be use with other tools too like a water jet cutters, jet cutters uses accurate high pressure water to clean or doing other things it can even cut metal.</p></td>
